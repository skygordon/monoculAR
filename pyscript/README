README: How to use monocular.py

Currently, the server is set up at /kevinren/monocular/monocular.py. Pass in a type, lat (latitude), and lon (longitude) argument. The type argument must be one of 'shuttle' or 'yelp'.

If the type argument is 'shuttle', then MIT Tech Shuttle information will be retrieved. If no shuttles are running, the script returns "ERROR: No shuttles found." If at least one shuttle is running, the script returns the closest stop name, followed by the number of shuttles (max 3) fetched from that stop, followed by the minutes until arrival of those shuttles, sorted from arriving soonest to latest. All distinct parameters (including the distinct times until arrival) are separated by newlines, for example:

W92 at Amesbury St
3
1.9 min
12.3 min
17.2 min

If the type argument is 'yelp', then Yelp restaurant information will be retrieved. Up to three restaurants, ordered by proximity to current location, will be retrieved. The script returns the number of restauants retrieved, followed by, for each restaurant, its name, rating, category, address, and distance from current location. All distinct parameters are separated by newlines. For example:
